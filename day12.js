/*DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

It starts at a node and recursively visits all its unvisited neighbors.
The algorithm can be implemented recursively or with a stack.
Purpose in This Code:

Explore all cells of the same "color" connected to a starting cell.
Calculate:
Area: The number of connected cells with the same color.
Perimeter: Boundary cells adjacent to cells of a different color.
Sides: Connections between cells of the same color.
5. DFS Implementation
Inputs:

visited: A Set tracking visited nodes to prevent infinite loops.
nodeKey: The current cell (as a string, e.g., "1,2").
color: The color weâ€™re looking for.
dir: The direction from which the current cell was entered (used for specific rules).
Logic:

Base Cases:
If the cell is not of the same color, check the neighbors and adjust perimeter or sides.
If the cell is already visited, return nothing.
Recursive Exploration:
Add the cell to visited.
For each neighbor (up, down, left, right), recursively apply DFS.  */
